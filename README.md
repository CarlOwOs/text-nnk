## Study of Text Embeddings in Language Models

This repository containes the code for the work on the study of text embeddings in language models. The work focuses on text and sentence embeddings in language models based on BERT.

The repository is structured as follows:

* `data`: contains the data used in the experiments
* `models`: contains the models used in the experiments
* `visualization`: contains the visualizations used in the experiments
* `src`: contains the source code of the project. The `src` folder containes folders for each context the code belongs to, including `data`, `models`, `visualzation`, and `utils`.

The `data` and `models` folders are not included in the repository, but can be generated from the source code.
